                    To our knowledge, an investigation of strengthening exercises targeting the hip abductor muscles as an intervention to reduce knee joint loading in people with knee OA has not been performed. Thus, the purpose of our study was to examine the inﬂuence of an 8-week home strengthening program for the hip abductor muscles on hip strength and the knee adduction moment in people with medial compartment knee OA. Given the functional importance of the hip abductor muscles, secondary objectives were to determine whether hip abductor strengthening would improve physical function and knee symptoms in this sample of people with knee OA. We hypothesized that, following the exercise program, participants with medial knee OA would demonstrate greater strength of the hip abductor muscles, a reduction in the knee adduction moment during gait, and improved physical functioning and decreased knee pain compared with a matched group of asymptomatic participants.

                    All testing was conducted in the Motor Performance Laboratory at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, with the exception of knee radiographs, which were completed in the Radiology Department at Kingston General Hospital. Testing sessions lasted approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. All individuals gave informed consent before participating.
                    Forty individuals with medial knee OA were recruited through newspaper advertisements and from the practices of orthopedic surgeons in Kingston, Ontario. Potential participants were included in the study if they met all of the following criteria22,23: age greater than 40 years, self-reported knee pain for most days of the month, physician diagnosis of knee OA, and radiographic evidence of medial compartment knee OA or evidence of cartilage loss in the medial compartment by arthroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging. For those participants with bilateral medial compartment OA, the more affected side (as identiﬁed by radiographic OA grade and symptoms) was selected as the test leg.
                    Participants were excluded if they had any of the following: intraarticular corticosteroid or viscosupplementation injection into either knee within the previous 3 months, signiﬁcant comorbidities, or a history of other medical conditions affecting the knee joint.24 Individuals with known hip OA, previous trauma affecting one or both hips, or previous replacement of any joint in the lower extremities also were excluded from the study. Finally, those who were receiving rehabilitation services for knee OA or performing a hip strengthening program at the time of testing were not eligible to participate.
